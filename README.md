# apitizer <!-- omit in toc -->

**apitizer** is inspired by [restful.js](https://github.com/marmelab/restful.js/tree/master), but is written in typescript with a slightly different and smaller api.

It allows you to access restul backends with a chainable, functional design. The actual side effects are [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) driven and allows you to integrate nicely with your own observables.

I've put heavy focus on delightful generics to make everyones life with foreign data just a little bit easier.
